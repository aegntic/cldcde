# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since GitHub CLI is not installed, please follow these manual steps to create the repository and push the code:

## 1. Create the Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Configure the repository:
   - **Repository name**: `cldcde-cc`
   - **Description**: `The unofficial community hub for Claude Code extensions and MCP servers`
   - **Visibility**: Private (select the Private radio button)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Add the Remote and Push

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you quick setup instructions. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cldcde-cc.git

# Rename the branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```

If you're using SSH instead of HTTPS:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/cldcde-cc.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Repository Settings (Optional)

After pushing, you might want to:

1. **Add Topics**: Go to Settings â†’ scroll down to Topics
   - Suggested: `claude-code`, `mcp`, `extensions`, `cloudflare`, `supabase`, `react`, `typescript`

2. **Set up Secrets**: Go to Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
   - Add your environment variables for GitHub Actions deployment

3. **Configure Branch Protection**: Go to Settings â†’ Branches
   - Add rule for `main` branch
   - Require pull request reviews before merging

## 4. Verify the Push

After pushing, verify that all files are present:
- README.md (comprehensive documentation)
- PLAN.md (project roadmap)
- TASKS.md (task tracker)
- LICENSE (MIT)
- All source code in `src/` and `frontend/`

## 5. Next Steps

1. **Enable GitHub Actions** if you want automated deployments
2. **Add collaborators** if working with a team
3. **Create issues** for tracking tasks from TASKS.md
4. **Set up project board** for visual task management

## Alternative: Using GitHub Desktop

If you prefer a GUI:
1. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "Add" â†’ "Add Existing Repository"
4. Navigate to `/Users/iamcatface/claude-extensions-website`
5. Click "Publish repository"
6. Set name to `cldcde-cc` and make it private
7. Click "Publish Repository"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:
```bash
# For HTTPS, you'll need a personal access token
# Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
# Generate a new token with 'repo' scope
# Use this token as your password when prompted

# For SSH, ensure your SSH key is added to GitHub
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy the output and add it to GitHub Settings â†’ SSH and GPG keys
```

Once you've successfully pushed the repository, you'll have a complete backup of the CLDCDE.CC project on GitHub! ðŸŽ‰
