3. **deep-research** - Context7 + sequential thinking integration
4. **code-review** - Security + quality analysis pipeline
5. **refactor** - Architecture improvement with safety checks

### Specialized Development Workflows
6. **documentation-generation** - Comprehensive docs with EARS requirements
7. **security-audit** - Full security analysis following EARS specifications
8. **performance-optimization** - Benchmarking and optimization with measurable criteria
9. **deployment-pipeline** - CI/CD with spec-driven gate approvals
10. **testing-automation** - Test suite creation with TDD validation

### Advanced Workflows
11. **api-development** - REST/GraphQL with EARS API contracts
12. **database-design** - Schema design with specification-driven constraints
13. **monitoring-setup** - Observability with measurable SLA requirements
14. **containerization** - Docker/K8s with spec-driven deployment criteria
15. **integration-testing** - Cross-system testing with EARS interface specs

### Specialized Workflows
16. **bug-hunting** - Issue detection with reproducible specifications
17. **feature-development** - End-to-end feature with EARS requirements
18. **infrastructure-as-code** - IaC with specification-driven compliance
19. **data-pipeline** - ETL with spec-driven data quality requirements
20. **custom-prompt** - User-defined workflow with EARS format requirements

## üìã Spec-Driven Foundation

### 5-Phase Workflow Process
```
PHASE 1: PLAN ‚Üí Establish project scope and objectives
PHASE 2: REQUIREMENTS ‚Üí EARS format specification ("WHEN... THEN...")
PHASE 3: DESIGN ‚Üí System architecture and component design
PHASE 4: TASKS ‚Üí Granular task breakdown with acceptance criteria
PHASE 5: EXECUTE ‚Üí TDD cycle implementation (Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor)
```

### EARS Requirements Format
```
WHEN [trigger condition] THEN the system SHALL [required response]

Examples:
- WHEN user enters incorrect credentials three times THEN system SHALL lock account for 15 minutes
- WHEN API endpoint is called THEN system SHALL return response within 200ms
- WHEN code is committed THEN system SHALL run full test suite automatically
```

## üëë Leadership Roles Per Workflow
