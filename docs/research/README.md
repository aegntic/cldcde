# ae-whitepapers

This repository hosts two foundational texts for the AEGNTIC project:

- **Computational Amplification Through Aegntic AI** (`computational-amplification-whitepaper.pdf`) — a practical framework for orchestrating parallel, agentic development with measurable ROI.  
  File:[computational-amplification-whitepaper.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22170763/computational-amplification-whitepaper.pdf)


- **Aegntic Whitepaper Notice** (`Aegntic Whitepaper Notice.pdf`) — the language/ontology rationale behind “AEGNT: Algorithms Evolving Generative Neural Thresholds.”

## TL;DR

- **Core principle:** “Computational Power = Engineering Success.” Intelligent orchestration converts raw compute into non-linear productivity gains.
- **Amplification Stack (L1→L5):** single agents → parallel agents → *isolated* parallel branches → automated best-of-breed selection → infinite learning loops.
- **Three-Folder System:** `IDocs` (persistent knowledge), `Specs` (planning/architecture), `.cloud` (reusable assets) to compound team learning.
- **MCP servers:** standardized action surfaces for Docker, GitHub/FS, databases/APIs, and browser automation—unlocking richer, verifiable agent behaviors.
- **Safety & QA:** hard limits for loops/parallelism, multi-criteria evaluation (correctness, performance, security, maintainability, innovation).
- **Economic case:** documented productivity/ROI deltas from agentic patterns and parallel worktrees.
- **Ontology:** “AEGNT” reframes so-called “AI” as evolving systems that generate *new thresholds* of understanding (not mere automation).

  `./computational-amplification-whitepaper.pdf`  [computational-amplification-whitepaper.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22170684/computational-amplification-whitepaper.pdf)

  Highlights: amplification equation; parallel/isolated branches via Git worktrees; infinite agent loops; MCP integration; safety rails; empirical ROI.

- **Aegntic Whitepaper Notice**  
  `./aegntic-whitepaper-notice.pdf` [aegntic-whitepaper-notice.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22170661/aegntic-whitepaper-notice.pdf)
 
  Highlights: “AEGNT: Algorithms Evolving Generative Neural Thresholds,” language precision, and the motivation to replace “artificial intelligence” with a more accurate ontology.

## Key Concepts

- **“Computational Power = Engineering Success.”** The central lever is orchestration—turning compute into exponential, not linear, output.
- **Amplification Stack:**  
  1) Single agent → 2) Parallel agents → 3) *Isolated* parallel agents (Git worktrees) → 4) Intelligent selection → 5) Infinite learning loops.
- **Three-Folder System:** `IDocs`, `Specs`, `.cloud` to institutionalize learnings across projects and time.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** consistent interfaces for tools (Docker, GitHub/FS), data, APIs, and the browser, enabling verifiable agent actions.
- **Safety & Governance:** resource ceilings for iterations/parallelism, evaluation pipelines, and human-in-the-loop review.
- **AEGNT Ontology:** *Algorithms Evolving Generative Neural Thresholds*—a linguistic correction and intent statement for how this field should be framed.
