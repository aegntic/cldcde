# Banana Image Generator Workflow

This workflow leverages the Seedream 4 (Banana) image generation system for creating professional-quality AI images.

## Quick Start

1. **Describe your image request** with as much detail as possible:
   - Subject matter
   - Style (photorealistic, artistic, illustration, etc.)
   - Mood/lighting
   - Color palette
   - Resolution requirements

2. **Use the generate_image tool** with your detailed prompt

## Best Practices

### For Maximum Quality
- Provide comprehensive descriptions with specific requirements
- Include style references for desired aesthetic
- Specify resolution, format, and usage requirements
- Include color palettes and identity elements for brand work
- Plan for multiple variations and refinements

### Example Prompts

**Product Photography:**
```
Create a luxury product advertisement for a smartwatch: 
photorealistic render, soft studio lighting, dark gradient background, 
gold accents, premium feel, 8K resolution, professional composition
```

**Artistic Creation:**
```
Generate a surrealist landscape combining digital impressionism 
with cyberpunk elements: vibrant neon colors, dreamy atmosphere, 
floating geometric shapes, twilight sky, high detail
```

**UI Design:**
```
Design a futuristic dashboard interface for a quantum computing app:
dark mode, glassmorphism effects, cyan and purple accent colors,
minimalist layout, holographic data visualizations
```

## Capabilities

- **Text-to-Image**: Natural language to visual output
- **Multi-Concept Fusion**: Combine multiple ideas cohesively
- **Style Control**: Fine-grained artistic and technical control
- **High Resolution**: Up to 16K native output
- **Professional Output**: Production-ready for all media

## Integration

This workflow uses Antigravity's built-in `generate_image` tool, which provides access to advanced AI image generation capabilities.
